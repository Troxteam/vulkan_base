# Vulkan Base
---

## Purpose for this project
This project is intended as a way to teach myself how the Vulkan graphics API works, and how it differs from OpenGL.
I am also planning to expand it to a point where I can use it as a base for other projects.

## Current functionality
-   Model Loading
-   Tessellation
-   Displacement Mapping

## This is the result of applying tessellation and displacement mapping.

## This is the mesh after tessellation but before displacement mapping.

## This is the base mesh before any tessellation or displacement is applied.
